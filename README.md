# PC Cleanup Utility

This program is a powerful cleanup tool written in batch made for Windows XP-7. I made this project for fun a few years back to solidify my knowledge on my first programming language, batch. v1 and v2 had aims for this program to be more of a "computer utility" tool rather than a cleanup one. But I changed my aim for v3. v5 was the last stable release which you can download [here](https://github.com/xp4xbox/PC-Cleanup-Utility/raw/master/Release/v5/PC%20Cleanup%20Utility%20v5.exe). It works perfectly on Windows XP-7 although it will not work on anything other than that. I discontinued this project while working on v6 due to massive changes that would have needed to be done in order for support on Windows 8+.
